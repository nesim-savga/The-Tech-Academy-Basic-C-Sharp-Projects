## Operators Assignment
Create an Employee class with Id, FirstName and LastName properties. 
In the Employee class, overload the “==” operator so it checks if two Employee objects are equal by comparing their Id property. Remember that comparison operators must be overloaded in pairs. 

In the "Program.cs" file, instantiate two objects of the Employee class and assign values to their properties. Then compare the two Employee objects using the newly overloaded operators and display the results.

## MethodApp
Create a class. In that class, create a void method that takes two integers as parameters. Have the method do a math operation on the first integer and display the second integer to the screen. 

In the Main() method of the console app, instantiate the class.

Call the method in the class, passing in two numbers. 

Call the method in the class, specifying the parameters by name.

Requirements

The first line of the program must be: “Welcome to Package Express. Please follow the instructions below.”

The user must then be prompted for the package weight.

If the weight is greater than 50, display the error message, “Package too heavy to be shipped via Package Express. Have a good day.” At this point the program would end.

The user must then be prompted for the package width.

Then the package height.

Then the package length.

If the dimensions total greater than 50, display the error message, “Package too big to be shipped via Package Express.” At this point the program would end.

Next, multiply the three dimensions (height, width, & length) together, and multiply the product by the weight. Finally, divide the outcome by 100.

The result of that calculation is the quote.

Display the quote to the user as a dollar amount.

For example: 

Welcome to Package Express. Please follow the instructions below.
Please enter the package weight:
40
Please enter the package width:
10
Please enter the package height:
 12
Please enter the package length:
 11
Your estimated total for shipping this package is: $528.00
